# description:  Let's apply what we've learnt about overriding and extending
#               Discourse javascript to a new example. Remember what we've covered:
#
#               1. Finding the relevant javascript<br>
#               2. Using the ``modifyClass`` and ``reopenWidget`` methods<br>
#               3. Preserving existing functionality<br>
#               4. Reusing existing functionality<br>
#
# exercise:     Modify and extend the javascript and css so that whenever someone
#               "likes" a post, the entire post turns pink. If they un-like
#               the post, the post should go back to its normal color. Record
#               your working code and post the recording in a comment.
#
#               This may seem complicated, but focus on what we've learnt and 
#               try to ignore the complexity in the code you don't yet understand.
#               The solution includes two api functions of a few lines each.
