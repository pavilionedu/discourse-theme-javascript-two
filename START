# title:        Working with Javascript (Part 2)
# description:  This is the second of three units about working with Javascript in 
#               Discourse themes. This is the seventh unit in the Discourse Theme 
#               Development course. When you're ready to start, clone this unit 
#               theme and start watching it on the [Discourse Theme Creator](https://theme-creator.discourse.org).

# title:        Modifying and extending functionality in Discourse
# description:  You may recall in the previous unit we discussed three different
#               reasons why you might be working with javascript in a Discourse
#               theme. In this unit we're going to look at the second: modifying 
#               and extending Discourse functionality.
#
#               For an example of a component that makes considerable changes to
#               the Discourse client javascript, check out the Discourse Loading
#               Slider component.

# title:        Do some background work
# description:  If you're looking to do a lot of modification or extension of 
#               Discourse functionality in a theme component, you'll also need 
#               to understand how the Discourse client uses Ember.js and virtual
#               DOM widgets. It's possible to avoid those subjects if you're just
#               interacting with Discourse's APIs or event-bus, however if you're
#               modifying Discourse javascript, you'll need to know how it works
#               on a structural level at some point.
#
#               If that applies to you, now would be a good time to complete a 
#               tutorial on Ember, particularly if you've never worked with an 
#               MVC javascript framework before (or you don't know what an MVC 
#               framework is). You'll find a few Ember tutorials linked in the 
#               references. If you find any better tutorials, or you'd like help 
#               with them, respond in the comments.
#
#               You'll also find an overview of how Discourse uses Virtual DOM
#               widgets in the references. If you've worked with React.js before
#               wirtual DOM widgets should make sense to you.
#
#               Knowledge of Ember.js and virtual DOM widgets won't be assumed in
#               this course, but it will help you complete it. If you're looking
#               to extend or modify Discourse javascript using theme components
#               for use in a production site it's required background work.
